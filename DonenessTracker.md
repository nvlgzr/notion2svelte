## üêû Known Bugs

- Magic is now‚Ä¶not. The current "Fix" to the `<script>` issue isn't really a fix.
- Bulleted lists do not reflect multiple depth levels
- Routes that introduce new "folders" fail because _notion2svelte_ doesn't create the folders before trying to save the files. Need a "Save and create" function. Hopefully Node already has?

# üêù Tasks/Ideas

- Toward fixing ‚Üë :
  - Replace Magic with a content-free data set passed to _every_ _notion2svelte_ component.
  - "Finish" implementing `synced_block`. The current implementation is implicit‚Ä¶it gets rendered by the default handler, which includes the block type in its rendering. This should be a nice, quick, near-freebie!
- More documentation tweaks
  - Ask for explicit help -> Doc design, code, usability
- Document: 3 required props in db: Name, Slug & Status
- Publish to npm
- Update **About _notion2svelte_**
  - Remember to call out keyboard interactions:
    - O: Displays sub-pages. Not sure why I chose 'O'
    - D: Distraction mode (shows external links)
    - I: Inspector mode
- Create Guide

# Icebox

- Add media queries to smooth out the worst layout bugs‚Ä¶possibly using https://github.com/cibernox/svelte-media? (I tried using https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-media-query but it didn't work)
- Update weird bottom-nav with something more menu-ish
- Implement `video` and `file` types
- Add support for auto-linking raw URLs
- Add config for custom component names so that naming conflicts can be avoided.
- Change the transformed page's Status to `Published` in Notion (w/appropriate .env override)
- Experiment with having the script do a git commit after successfully saving. Here, I suspect, many monsters lurk, so probably the first working something will be pretty problematic
- Default to `prerender=true`?
- Add password-based Admin mode with links back to Notion pages
  - MVP: security through obscurity -> type secret into the void to magically toggle
  - Later: Add actual Auth^2, but still with no affordances
- Implement all `mention` types
- Implement `bookmark`?
- Implement `table_of_contents`?
- Implement `breadcrumb`?
- Implement `link_preview`? (https://www.notion.so/guides/notion-api-link-previews-feature)
