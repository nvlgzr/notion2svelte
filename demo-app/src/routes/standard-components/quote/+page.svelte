		If you‚Äôve ever felt the sudden urge to leap off of a tall building, you‚Äôre already familiar with
		the concept of&nbsp;<em>l‚Äôappel du vide&nbsp;</em>‚Äî a French term that literally translates as
		‚Äúthe call of the void‚Äù and refers to a sudden but passing urge to engage in self-destructive
		behavior. I‚Äôve always heard this voice, although its specific suggestions change from time to
		time. Rather than jumping from a great height, for example, it might tell me to crawl down onto
		the BART tracks on my commute home or chug the drain cleaner sitting under my sink.

		When I began to picture myself jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge last winter, I largely
		brushed it off as just another example of those disturbing but easily dismissed thoughts. True,
		I was feeling a little off, but I had grown so accustomed to these images throughout my life
		that I was hardly fazed by them. But as I sunk further and further into depression, I realized
		that this was something more. Jumping off the bridge was no longer just an intrusive thought. It
		was a fantasy ‚Äî one that increased in strength each time I crossed the bridge in the morning on
		my way to work and in the evening on my commute home.

		Creating a physical barrier to prevent suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge was initially
		discussed in the 1950s, but the idea didn‚Äôt gain traction until much later. Earlier efforts to
		create a barrier faced an uphill battle as opponents declared that proposed designs, such as
		barbed wire fences, were an eyesore that would detract from the bridge‚Äôs grandeur. Besides,
		critics argued, a barrier would only encourage suicidal people to choose a different method ‚Äî

		The history of suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge is a long and sordid one, but there is
		nevertheless reason to be hopeful. On a large scale, the soon-to-be-erected suicide net
		deterrent system is expected to save countless lives. Barriers at formerly very active suicide
		sites like the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building have been found to drastically reduce
		the number of deaths.

		When I was actively suicidal, I couldn‚Äôt stand hearing things like ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs
		always darkest before the dawn.‚Äù While I knew that people who offered these sentiments meant
		well, it always came across as condescending and clich√©. If you‚Äôre struggling with suicidal
		thoughts, I won‚Äôt echo those same vague platitudes to you, but I will ask you to consider that
		the negative thoughts that have lodged themselves in your brain are not objective. You might
		think that there‚Äôs no point in continuing on, but you have to remember ‚Äî just because you think
		something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. And first and foremost, I encourage you to get help from a
		professional.
