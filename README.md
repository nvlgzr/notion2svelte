# notion2svelte

When `notion2svelte` is ready, it will allow me to add a page to my Pages database in Notion, mark it as "ready to publish", and, once notion2svelte has been run, have that page committed as a new, Svelte-native page in my website's repo, where it's just one quick push to actually publish.

(Note: to use `npm run magic`, firt install `entr`. On my Mac, this involved no more than `brew install entr`)
